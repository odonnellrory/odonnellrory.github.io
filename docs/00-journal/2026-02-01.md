# 2026/02/01 - Open Media Vault

Added cockpit to pve1 and pve2.

Added Ollama LXC to pve2.

Added Jellyfin to pve1.

Installed 2x 2TB HDD's to pve2.  These will be the storage for jellyfin.

Reserved all these services IP's on my router's DHCP.

Apparantly rsync is better for copying images over ssh than scp.  Something about timestamps and other data.  

Used rsync to backup my photos from the harddrives before I wipe them.

Created Open Media Vault VM on pve2.
