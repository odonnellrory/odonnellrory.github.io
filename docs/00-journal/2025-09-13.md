# 13/09/25 - Nixconf
---

I've spent most of today learning my new OS.  I set up protonvpn with wireguard, very similar process to on Arch.  

Installed my dotfiles, set up Alacritty, widgets, still on KDE but thinking of setting up Hyprland tomorrow.  I'm really enjoying writing everything out for the OS, it's like making your own distro.

I've moved my entire ```/etc/nixos/``` into my dotfiles repo and I have renamed it locally as ```~/OS/```.

I have also restructured my Home directory.  I wanted to organise files in my Downloads/ into a sort of documents/bin directory.  I got the idea of using latin to have a mechanicus feel to it, so I've emptied my home directory completely, it only has OS/ Omni/ and Downloads/, I want to look into changing the name of Downloads later, as I think if I rename it then apps like firefox might just remake the directory.  

```Omni``` is for me to move everything that is new in home into more organised areas.
This keeps my home directory tidy for important things that I need quick access to.

I also need to repartition the device tomorrow.  I gave Nix 80GB but I'm happy for it to be the main partition, and I don't need the Ubuntu partition.  I did want to turn it into a VM but I can't be bothered juggling the disk space.  Maybe it can be done using SSH, like how I sent my firefox files using SCP the other day.
