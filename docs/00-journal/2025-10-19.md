# 2025/10/19 - about:config Firefox
---
## Changelog

Removed any lines pulling any kde related software from nixconfig.

If you go to about:config in firefox, you can edit a lot more attributes than the settings menu usually allows for.

I wanted it to stop trying to restore the previous session, as it always seemed to do when I open it.

It turns out that this isn't the intended behaviour, it is supposed to only attempt to restore the previous session after a crash.  But to close firefox, I don't use the X, I use a Gnome keybinding to kill the process, this must count as a crash in Firefox's eyes.

In about:config there is a field ```browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash``` which is set to true by default.  Changing this to false and now my Firefox always opens my homepage (this website).  Beautiful.
