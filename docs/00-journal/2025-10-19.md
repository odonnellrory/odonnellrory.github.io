# 2025/10/19 - about:config Firefox
---
## Changelog

Removed any lines pulling any kde related software from nixconfig.

---


If you go to about:config in firefox, you can edit a lot more attributes than the settings menu usually allows for.

I wanted it to stop trying to restore the previous session, as it always seemed to do when I open it.

It turns out that this isn't the intended behaviour, it is supposed to only attempt to restore the previous session after a crash.  But to close firefox, I don't use the X, I use a Gnome keybinding to kill the process, this must count as a crash in Firefox's eyes.

In about:config there is a field ```browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash``` which is set to true by default.  Changing this to false and now my Firefox always opens my homepage (this website).  Beautiful.

The journal helper from yesterday is formatting the dates in YYYY/MM/DD, this was a mistake I will fix now.

Made a zsh function for cd'ing into the WoW addon directories, with a nice option for you to choose between classic and retail.

```
# cd to World of Warcraft AddOns (classic era default)
wowcd() {
  emulate -L zsh -o errexit -o nounset -o pipefail

  local wowbase="$HOME/Omni/Ludi/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/World of Warcraft"
  local flavor="${1:-}"

  case "${flavor:l}" in
    retail|r|_retail_)
      flavor="_retail_"
      ;;
    classic|era|_classic_era_|c|e)
      flavor="_classic_era_"
      ;;
    "")
      print "Choose WoW flavor:"
      print "  1) Classic Era (default)"
      print "  2) Retail"
      read "?Enter number [default 1]: " choice
      case "${choice:-1}" in
        1|"") flavor="_classic_era_";;
        2) flavor="_retail_";;
        *)
          print "Invalid choice; defaulting to Classic Era."
          flavor="_classic_era_"
          ;;
      esac
      ;;
    *)
      print -u2 -- "Unknown flavor: ${1}. Use 'retail' or 'classic'."
      return 2
      ;;
  esac

  local target="${wowbase}/${flavor}/Interface/AddOns"
  if [[ -d "$target" ]]; then
    cd -- "$target"
    print -- "→ ${PWD}"
  else
    print -u2 -- "Missing directory: $target"
    return 1
  fi
}


```

I also noticed that my dotfiles in ~/.OS/ are not actually symlinked.   So they weren't being backed up to git.  I have corrected this as below:



```

   Λ   ~/.OS   cp ~/.zsh* .
   Λ   ~/.OS   ls -a
.   .aliases  .git      nixos      .zshFunctions  .zshrc
..  bin       hyprland  README.md  .zsh_history
   Λ   ~/.OS   rm .zsh_history
   Λ   ~/.OS   ls -a
.  ..  .aliases  bin  .git  hyprland  nixos  README.md  .zshFunctions  .zshrc
   Λ   ~/.OS   cp ~/.aliases .
   Λ   ~/.OS   nvim .aliases
   Λ   ~/.OS   nvim .zshFunctions
   Λ   ~/.OS   rm ~/.zshrc
   Λ   ~/.OS   ln -sfn ~/.OS/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
   Λ   ~/.OS   rm ~/.aliases
   Λ   ~/.OS   ln -sfn ~/.OS/.aliases ~/.aliases
   Λ   ~/.OS   rm ~/.zshFunctions
   Λ   ~/.OS   ln -sfn ~/.OS/.zshFunctions ~/.zshFunctions
   Λ   ~/.OS   sz
...
   Λ   ~/.OS   sz
Having fun?
   Λ   ~/.OS


```

sz is just an alias I made for ```source ~/.zshrc``` that will echo a random remark when you do it.
