# 2026/01/07 - Raspberry Pi 4B

All my new kit arrived today.
Got a PoE switch and a Raspberry Pi 4B

Now, proxmox does not run natively on ARM processors BUT it can be hosted ontop of the Debian trixie that Raspberry Pi OS provides.

## Provisioning the Switch

On my routers interface I can see the model number of the new switch alongside a designated IP address, entering this IP into the browser takes me to the switch's web interface.  However, it needs an account, so let's consult the installation guide.

The default username and password is **admin** in both fields.

First thing I noticed once into the interface is that the location, time and date are wrong.  So I started by going through the System Info settings and changing these.

There is a table in the PoE tab where I can see which devices are currently drawing PoE and how much voltage.
