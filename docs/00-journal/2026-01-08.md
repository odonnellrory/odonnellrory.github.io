# 2026/01/08 - Enabling SSH without a monitor

The raspberry pi does not have SSH enabled by default and I don't have an adapter to plug the machine into a monitor to see the CLI.

ChatGPT is telling me that all I need to do is add an empty file called "ssh" to thebootfs partition.

So I've done that, let's see.

**Huh, it actually worked.**
