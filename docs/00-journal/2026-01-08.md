# 2026/01/08 - Enabling SSH without a monitor

The raspberry pi does not have SSH enabled by default and I don't have an adapter to plug the machine into a monitor to see the CLI.

ChatGPT is telling me that all I need to do is add an empty file called "ssh" to thebootfs partition.

So I've done that, let's see.

**Huh, it actually worked.**
The SSH goes through now instead of being refused, but there is no user set up.

Okay so it turns out there is an official imaging software I can use for a headless setup to create the user before installing the OS.  

After reflashing the SD card with the new Pi OS, it got a new SSH key, giving me this output:

```
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the ED25519 key sent by the remote host is

Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /home/rory/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending ED25519 key in /home/rory/.ssh/known_hosts:21
Host key for 192.168.0.240 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.


```

That's funny.

```ssh-keygen -R 192.168.0.240```

And we're in.
