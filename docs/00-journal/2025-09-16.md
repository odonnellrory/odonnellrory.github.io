# 16/09/25 - Recap

Repartitioned the Nix device.  I expanded the Nix partition by 400GB and deleted the Ubuntu partition.

Symlinked my Nix config file into ~/OS and renamed ~/.dotfiles (and accompanying GitHub repo) to OS.  

Made my Nix config modular:

```
    Λ   ~   tree OS
OS
├── hyprland.conf
├── kdekeyboard.kksrc
└── nixos
    ├── configuration.nix
    ├── desktop-environments
    │   ├── gnome.nix
    │   └── plasma.nix
    ├── display-managers
    │   └── sddm.nix
    └── hardware-configuration.nix

4 directories, 7 files
   Λ   ~

```

So now my dotfiles repo has my Nix configuration, I can easily set up a new device with all the same software as my home device.

I made directories for desktop environments and display managers.   The original config file is then divided into these folders and pulled into the main file.

Modularity :)

I also expandedon the ~/Omni idea and learned how to change my default directories by editing ```~/.config/user-dirs.dirs``` so now instead of "Downloads" or "Documents" as my default Home directory suite, I have:

```
XDG_DESKTOP_DIR="$HOME/Omni/"
XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR="$HOME/Chaos/"
XDG_TEMPLATES_DIR="$HOME/Omni/Librarium/"
XDG_PUBLICSHARE_DIR="$HOME/Omni/Basilica/"
XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR="$HOME/Omni/Librarium/"
XDG_MUSIC_DIR="$HOME/Omni/Librarium/"
XDG_PICTURES_DIR="$HOME/Omni/Librarium/"
XDG_VIDEOS_DIR="$HOME/Omni/Librarium/"

```

So now the lay out of my file system looks like this:

```
   Λ   ~   tree -d -L 3
.
├── Chaos
├── Omni
│   ├── Anima
│   ├── Basilica
│   │   └── odonnellrory.github.io
│   ├── Librarium
│   │   ├── Imagines
│   │   ├── Ludi
│   │   ├── Machinae
│   │   └── Scripturae
│   └── Reliquiae
└── OS
    └── nixos
        ├── desktop-environments
        └── display-managers

16 directories
   Λ   ~


```

I should probably change my prompt from Lambda (Λ) too since I'm not on Arch anymore and I picked that because it looks like the Arch logo.  I'm thinking maybe Omega (Ω) because it is round like the Nix logo.  Maybe I won't.

**Anima** is for personal documents.

**Basilica** is for anything public facing, such as my website repo.

**Librarium** is Documents.

**Reliquiae** is for all of my projects that I never finish.

Thoweris was mostly an exercise in learning about ```~/.config/user-dirs.dirs```.  It's cool to know that I can customise the file system like that.
