# 11/10/25 - catall.sh

There's a few things I've done on this machine since moving to Nix and a few more things that I want to do now, a backlog.

TO DO:

 - Add a VPN GUI to hyprland
 - Sort out waybar, I've installed it but not configured it.
 - Make an interactive to do list for the home page, that'd be well cool.  With colour coding.  Maybe I can hook it up to task warrior.

```
    clear && cd ~/.OS/ && ~/.OS/catall.sh | wl-copy

```

wl-copy copies to the clipboard.  catall.sh is a shell script i made that cats all files below it recursively.  This combination copies all of my nix repository, which included my hyprland config and some other things, to the clipboard.   Very useful.

By making this into an alias, I can do it with one command.  But even better, I can keybind that command, giving me a dedicated button for copying my operating systems config files to the clipboard.

To get hyprland to use the shell script, I made another script in ```~/.local/bin``` 

```
set -euo pipefail
cd "$HOME/.OS"
~/.OS/catall.sh | wl-copy

```
