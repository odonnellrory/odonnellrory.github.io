# 2026/02/02 - Docker Outage

Came home today, booted up the switch (the pi is poe) and the services that I host on the pi did not come online.

First thing I did was try ssh into it, that works fine.

So then inside the pi:

```
ip -br a

```
This shows what services are up on the pi.

```docker0 DOWN```
Does not mean docker was actually down.   Pi-Hole can be connected to via IP.  Caddy is the one failing, so I can't use my custom DNS.

```
● docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Mon 2026-02-02 02:04:56 GMT; 17h ago

```
Docker is active.

```docker ps -a``` shows Caddy is restarting every 30 seconds or so.

So maybe the Caddyfile changes I made last night are causing problems.

My jellyfin block ended in a path, 

```
192.168.0.190:8096/

```
I had a / at the end of the port.   Mystery solved.

Caddy is back online.

## 2nd Issue - Forgetting how Caddy works with DNS

So jellyfin.home.arpa wasn't working, I thought I had it all figured out.  I didn't.  I set the pi-hole DNS to send jellyfin.home.arpa to the jellyfin LXC's IP.  I forgot that you send it to Caddy's IP.  DUH.  How else is Caddy supposed to work if you are never reaching it.

Now it's working.

TO DO:  Write a SOP for Caddy and Pi-Hole DNS.
