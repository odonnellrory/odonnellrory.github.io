# 30/12/25 - Zsh plugins on Fedora OS / Proxmoxx Game Server

I installed **Zsh + Oh My Zsh** on Fedora as I usually do.  
However, I had **no syntax highlighting**, **no autosuggestions**, and **tab completion was case-sensitive**.

This setup had worked previously on Arch and Nix, so at first I assumed Fedora was behaving differently.

It wasn’t.

---

## The Issue

My `.zshrc` **never sourced Oh My Zsh**.

I had:

    ```
    plugins=(
      git
      zsh-autosuggestions
      zsh-syntax-highlighting
    )
    ```

…but without sourcing Oh My Zsh, this does **nothing**.

The plugins were cloned correctly, but **never loaded**.

---

## The Fix

1. Define the Oh My Zsh path
2. Source `oh-my-zsh.sh` **after** defining plugins

```
export ZSH="$HOME/.oh-my-zsh"

plugins=(
  git
  zsh-autosuggestions
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
)

source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
```

After reloading (`source ~/.zshrc`), plugins worked immediately.

## Proxmox and Passwords

The first obstacle was self-inflicted: I’d forgotten the root password to my Proxmox machine.

That led me down a rabbit hole I probably *should* have gone down earlier. Using GRUB, I learned how trivial it is to drop into a root shell on an unencrypted Linux system if you have physical access. No exploit, no vulnerability, just expected behaviour.

That was slightly unsettling, but also clarifying.  
**Physical access is root access** unless you encrypt the disk.

Lesson logged. Mental note: LUKS everywhere.

Password reset done, Proxmox back online.

## VM Planning (and the First Wrong Turn)

The plan was to spin up a lightweight VM and run the Skyrim Together server in Docker.

I started with **Debian**, because that’s usually my instinct for servers. Installed it headless, got SSH working, and started reading the Skyrim Together server docs.

Immediately noticed something I should have read sooner, this guide assumes Ubuntu.

Docker instructions, package names, repos, all Ubuntu-centric. Debian *would* work, but if the guide is for Ubuntu I may as well just make a Ubuntu VM.

I deleted the VM.

Created a fresh **Ubuntu Server VM** on Proxmox instead.

Set up SSH so I could paste commands from my Fedora laptop instead of typing everything.

---

## Docker: Calm Before the Storm

Installed Docker following the official guide.

Immediately hit:

- GPG key errors
- Docker repo refusing to update
- Packages “not available”

Classic.

Fixed the repo keys, re-ran updates, installed Docker properly. Then I ran straight into another gotcha:

```

permission denied while trying to connect to the docker socket

```

Right, forgot the part where adding a user to the `docker` group doesn’t apply until you log out.

Logged out, logged back in, tried again.

Docker worked.

---

## Skyrim Together Server: Actually Running

Created directories under `/opt/docker/skyrimserver` for config, data, and logs.

Ran the container.

It started cleanly. No crashes. No errors.

Port forwarding configured on the router.

Server online.

## Fedora: The FPS Horror Show

Then I launched the game.

And immediately noticed something was very wrong.

FPS was awful. 

This was confusing because:
- Same hardware
- Same game
- Worked fine on Arch and Nix previously

So I checked the obvious things.

```

nvidia-smi

```

Command not found.

Ah.

---

## NVIDIA Drivers (or Lack Thereof)

Fedora, as it turns out, does not ship NVIDIA drivers by default.  
I had somehow been gaming on **Intel integrated graphics** without realising it.

Installed RPM Fusion.
Installed `akmod-nvidia`.
Waited for the kernel modules to build.
Rebooted.

Ran:

```

nvidia-smi

```

There it was. RTX 3050, alive and well.

Checked Vulkan devices, NVIDIA showed up correctly.

Launched Steam again.

FPS fixed instantly.

---

## Proton, GE-Proton, and One Last Hurdle

The Skyrim Together guide used **GE-Proton**, which wasn’t in Steam’s dropdown.

Installed ProtonUp-Qt.
Installed the correct GE-Proton version.

Launched Skyrim.

Connected to the server.

It worked.

---

- Proxmox recovered
- Ubuntu Server VM running clean
- Docker hosting Skyrim Together
- Port forwarded
- Friends connected
- Fedora GPU drivers fixed
- Game playable

- If a guide assumes Ubuntu, just use Ubuntu.
- Docker errors are usually permissions or repos.
- Fedora will happily let you game on the wrong GPU without telling you.
- Physical access without disk encryption means root access.
- Nothing works first try, but everything leaves a paper trail if you write it down.
