# 30/12/25 - Zsh Plugins on Fedora

## Context

I installed **Zsh + Oh My Zsh** on Fedora as I usually do.  
However, I had **no syntax highlighting**, **no autosuggestions**, and **tab completion was case-sensitive**.

This setup had worked previously on Arch and Nix, so at first I assumed Fedora was behaving differently.

It wasn’t.

---

## The Issue

My `.zshrc` **never sourced Oh My Zsh**.

I had:

    ```
    plugins=(
      git
      zsh-autosuggestions
      zsh-syntax-highlighting
    )
    ```

…but without sourcing Oh My Zsh, this does **nothing**.

The plugins were cloned correctly, but **never loaded**.

---

## The Fix

1. Define the Oh My Zsh path
2. Source `oh-my-zsh.sh` **after** defining plugins

```
export ZSH="$HOME/.oh-my-zsh"

plugins=(
  git
  zsh-autosuggestions
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
)

source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
```

After reloading (`source ~/.zshrc`), plugins worked immediately.
