# 04/11/25 - Windows 11 Virtual Machine

Installed Gnome Boxes, I've not used this software before but I have used VirtualBox.  

Installing Windows 11, it said that the VM doesnt meet system requirements, needs TPM 2.0 and secure boot.

So today I learned how to bypass that.

Microsoft left a side door open for testers to get around the limitations of W11.

Shift F10 opens a command prompt, and in here I can type regedit to bring up the registry editor.

If i go into ``` HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup ``` and make a new key called LabConfig, then inside it add these DWORD values and set them to 1:

BypassTPMCheck

BypassSecureBootCheck

BypassRAMCheck

Then close the regedit and CMD, retry the installation, it actually works, and Windows 11 installed successfully.
