My crimping tool arrived yesterday so I cut down my 100m cat6 cable and nowhave many cat6 patch cables.
Excellent.

Went to backup the Ubuntu laptop to find that Ubuntu has a backup software packaged in.  That's nice, but the laptop is moving over to NixOS.

Made a new section for hack the box.  I was going to put it into knowledge base, but if I keep it up then it will get too big for KB's and should be it's own section.
Camino dir is now 03-camino instead of 02-aboutme.  02-aboutme has been replaced with 02-hack-the-box.
